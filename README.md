### ITI - SQL Server Course

Here I will summarize the ITI - SQL Sever on the (Developer Channel) on YouTube on this link ==> (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLesfn4TAj57V5vvJKvYxofwY2hbyjk9-E).

The summary will be as a Word Files to summarize the content of each video, with sone screenshots to important things explained in the video (Don't worry bro, all screenshots that exists in files are existing in the Separated folder called Course Images).

I Hope this to help you in the C# and .Net Track specially in the Database part and all things related to it.

I will be so happy to hear your opinions about my summary to the videos, and if you have any changes just send to me on my E-mail ==> (mhmdalkhlawy45@gmail.com).

## Best Wishes for you bro on your learning trip, and don't forget I'm waiting your helpful opinion, Thanks Bro.
